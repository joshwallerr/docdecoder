## What is DocDecoder?

DocDecoder is a free (no account required) browser extension that summarises web policies with GPT-4.

**Our aim is to solve one of the internet's oldest problems - nobody reads the poicies they bind themselves to online.**

This extension takes the URL of any web/legal policy and 'summarises' it in a way that explains *exactly* what the user is agreeing to, at a glance.

Any potentiallly harmful/sinister terms are highlighted in red.
